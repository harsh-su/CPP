we need to first compile suing g++ -g ... to generate source file for gbd 
now we can eiher use gbd ./prog or we can use gbt--tui ./prog 

commnads 
-> next  will take us to the succesive breakpoints 
-> step will take us into the implementation of the function 
-> break will stop ata the point 
-> list will show the the next ten line 
-> print can show us the value of the vairable at the time ( really helpful during segmentation faults )
    also shows us the field and gvie us type 
-> up to go up the stack of a running program ( after attaching gbd to a process)
-> using target we can know store the value with time 
    calling reverse will take us back ..
->for polymorphism 
    whatis ___ to know object 
    info vbtl ___ to know how an object is behaving 



can also use -Wall and -Wextra to show some extra flags at compile time 


Pointer pitfalls 
if px is pointed to nullptr then dereferencing it will cause SEGFAULT
